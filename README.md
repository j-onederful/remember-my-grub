 ### What's happenin
 ---
 In this game the player must rely on their memory to match which up two of the same types of food in a 20 box grid. In order to succeed, player must finish matching all of the food within a minute or else they will starve. Player will recieve two lifelines (incorrect guesses), but as is the case in America's favorite pasttime, three strikes and you're out.

 ### MVP
 ---
 * Create a grid screen with twenty boxes
 * Render instructions button and start button
 * Upon pressing of start button, have grid show you locations of foods for 1 second before hiding again
 * Link pictures that appear once button on top is clicked
 * Use 'if' statement (?) to denote how many times wrong answers are clicked (three times and game over)
 * Have countdown clock running down from a minute once images are hidden after start button pressed
 * Once matched pair is clicked, leave those two images visible on grid

 ### Stretch Goals
 ---
 * Make randomizer that throws in more types of food
 * Not really sure what else, any suggestions welcomed
