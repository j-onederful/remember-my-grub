# __Remember Your Grub__

 ### What's happenin
 ---
 In this game the player must rely on their memory to match which up two of the same types of food in a 20 box grid. In order to succeed, player must match all of the food.
 
 ### Approach
 ---
 I decided that for this project I really needed to set my focus on getting a handle on DOM and just JavaScript use in general, so I decided upon taking on making a relatively simple game. I began by setting up the HTML and CSS, and once I had my grids in the correct place, I went ahead on tackling the JavaScript.
 
 ### Tech Used
 ---
 In this game I tried to work within JavaScript as much as possible, using functions to enter and format my pictures into the gameboxes, as well as functions to randomize the order of those pictures. I made use of DOM applications such as querySelector's and eventListener's as well in order to meet my goals. I also used a setTimeout function to make sure that the cards were both being shown when there was not a match before being flipped back over.

 ### Reflection
 ---
 I struggled quite a lot in making this game, partly because it seemed like I had just forgotten huge chunks of things that we had already learned and also because I pursued a pretty difficult route of getting the game functional. Although this cause quite a lot of frustration and anxiety for me, I'm glad that I toiled away on my own for the first half of the project week because I learned a few things, chief among them that next go around I've got to live by the mantra of keep it simple stupid.

 When I couldn't figure things out on my own I was able to lean on my instructors as well as classmates who were extremely helpful in guiding me towards the solutions to my problems without outright telling me what to do. I now feel like I am in a better place than where I was the week before and once again ready to get my soul crushed by my lack of understanding of the next Unit.

 ### MVP
 ---
 * Create a grid screen with twenty boxes
 * Render instructions button, start button and new game button
 * Link pictures that appear once button on top is clicked (done in JavaScript)
 * Once matched pair is clicked, leave those two images visible on grid

 ### Stretch Goals
 ---
 * Make randomizer that shuffles food location
 * Upon pressing of start button, have grid show you locations of foods for 1 second before hiding again
 * Use 'if' statement (?) to denote how many times wrong answers are clicked (three times and game over)
 * Have countdown clock running down from a minute once images are hidden after start button pressed
